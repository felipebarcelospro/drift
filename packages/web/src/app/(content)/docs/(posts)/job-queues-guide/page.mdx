# Job Queues in Drift KV

Drift KV provides robust support for background processing through job queues, allowing developers to handle long-running tasks and offload work from real-time processes. This guide will walk you through how to use job queues in Drift KV.

## Introduction to Job Queues
Job queues are useful for tasks that do not need to be processed synchronously, such as sending welcome emails, resizing images, or making HTTP requests to external services. Drift KV's job queue system provides:

- **Type-safe job definitions**
- **Background processing**
- **Retry logic** for failed jobs
- **Hooks for customization**

## Creating a Job Queue
To create a job queue, you need to define it using the `DriftQueue` class. Below is an example of a basic job queue that handles sending welcome emails to users.

```typescript
import { DriftQueue } from "drift-kv";


const sendWelcomeEmail = new DriftQueue({
  name: "send-welcome-email",
  description: "Send welcome email to new users",
  schema: (z) => ({
    id: z.string().uuid(),
    name: z.string(),
    email: z.string().email(),
  }),
  hooks: {
    onJobBeforeSchedule: async (data) => {
      console.log("Preparing to enqueue email job:", data);
    },
    onJobStart: async (data) => {
      console.log("Starting email job processing:", data);
    },
    onJobEnd: async (data) => {
      console.log("Email job completed successfully:", data);
    },
    onJobError: async (error, data) => {
      console.error("Error processing email job:", error);
    },
  },
  handler: async (data) => {
    // Your email sending logic goes here
    console.log(`Sending email to ${data.email}: Welcome, ${data.name}!`);
  },
});
```

### Key Elements
- **Name and Description**: Identify the queue and describe its purpose.
- **Schema**: Define the shape of the data the job should handle using Zod, making it type-safe.
- **Hooks**: Customize behavior at various stages of the job lifecycle.
- **Handler**: The actual logic that runs for each job.

## Scheduling Jobs
Once you have a job queue defined, you can schedule jobs to run. Below is an example of scheduling a job to send a welcome email.

```typescript
await drift.queues.sendWelcomeEmail.schedule({
  data: {
    id: "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    name: "Felipe",
    email: "felipe@example.com",
  },
});
```

- **data**: The payload for the job, which must conform to the schema.

## Processing Jobs
To process jobs, you need to call the `process` method. You can configure the number of concurrent workers, timeouts, and worker-level hooks.

```typescript
await drift.process({
  topics: ["sendWelcomeEmail"],
  hooks: {
    onWorkerStart: async () => {
      console.log("Worker started.");
    },
    onWorkerEnd: async () => {
      console.log("Worker finished.");
    },
    onWorkerError: async (error) => {
      console.error("Worker error:", error);
    },
    onJobStart: async (job) => {
      console.log("Starting job processing:", job);
    },
  },
});
```

### Configuration Parameters
- **Hooks**: You can define hooks to run custom logic when a worker starts, ends, or encounters an error.

## Retry Mechanisms
Drift KV allows you to configure retry attempts for jobs. The `retryAttempts` option, set in the queue definition, specifies how many times the job should be retried if it fails. By default, if no retry attempts are defined, the job will not be retried.

Example:
```typescript
hooks: {
  onJobError: async (error, data) => {
    if (error.code === "SMTP_ERROR") {
      // Handle SMTP errors
      await notifyAdmin(error);
    }
    
    // Log error details
    await logError({
      queue: "email",
      error,
      data,
    });
  },
}
```

This helps ensure that temporary issues, such as network failures, do not cause jobs to fail permanently.

## Job Queue Configuration
Drift's job queues are highly configurable, enabling you to tailor the settings to the needs of your application.

### Job Queue Options
- **Retry Attempts**: Set the number of retries to handle potential failures.
- **Timeout**: Maximum duration to wait for a job to complete.
- **Hooks**: Lifecycle hooks for customizing the behavior during different stages.
- **Concurrency Control**: Manage how many jobs should run concurrently for better resource allocation.

### Example Use-Cases
- **Sending Notifications**: Offload sending email or SMS notifications.
- **Background Processing**: Execute computationally expensive tasks in the background.
- **Data Syncing**: Sync data across different services or databases asynchronously.

## Summary
Job queues in Drift KV are an essential tool for handling background tasks, offloading non-essential processes from your core application, and ensuring your application runs smoothly without unnecessary delays. By leveraging type-safe definitions, retry mechanisms, and lifecycle hooks, Drift KV provides a powerful, customizable way to manage background tasks.

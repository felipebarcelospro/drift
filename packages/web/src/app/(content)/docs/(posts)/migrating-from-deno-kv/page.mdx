# Migrating from Deno KV to Drift KV: A Comprehensive Guide

Learn how to seamlessly transition from Deno KV to Drift KV, and explore the advantages of using a type-safe ORM in your Deno projects.

## Introduction

In the world of Deno, Deno KV has been a go-to key-value database for many developers. However, as projects grow in complexity, the need for a more robust, type-safe solution becomes evident. This is where Drift KV steps in—a powerful, type-safe ORM designed for modern TypeScript environments.

This guide will help you understand the benefits of migrating from Deno KV to Drift KV and provide a step-by-step migration plan. We'll also compare the two systems directly to help you make an informed decision.

## Understanding Deno KV

Deno KV is a key-value database built directly into the Deno runtime. It excels at storing simple data structures with very fast reads and writes. Here are some of its key features:

- **Built-in Database**: No external setup required; it's part of the Deno runtime.
- **Simple API**: Easy to use with basic CRUD operations.
- **Fast Performance**: Optimized for quick read and write operations.

### Limitations of Deno KV

Despite its advantages, Deno KV has some limitations:

- **Lack of Type Safety**: No built-in support for TypeScript type safety.
- **Basic Functionality**: Limited features compared to full-fledged ORMs.
- **Manual Schema Management**: Developers must manage data schemas manually.

## Introducing Drift KV

Drift KV is a type-safe ORM tailored for Deno KV and modern TypeScript projects. It extends the capabilities of Deno KV by providing:

- **Type Safety with Zod**: Define schemas using Zod for runtime type checking.
- **Advanced Querying**: Powerful query capabilities similar to traditional ORMs.
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: Intercept and modify behavior with hooks.
- **Job Queues**: Built-in support for background processing tasks.
- **Real-time Subscriptions**: Monitor and react to data changes in real-time.

## Why Migrate to Drift KV?

Migrating to Drift KV offers several benefits:

- **Enhanced Type Safety**: Reduce runtime errors with strict type enforcement.
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Simplify data interactions with a familiar ORM-like API.
- **Scalability**: Better suited for complex applications with growing data needs.
- **Additional Features**: Access to job queues and real-time subscriptions without extra setup.

## Migration Guide

### Setting Up Drift KV

Install Drift KV:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @drift-kv/core

# Using Deno
deno add jsr:@drift-kv/core
```

Initialize Drift KV in Your Project:

```typescript
import { Drift } from "@drift-kv/core";

const drift = new Drift({
  client: await Deno.openKv(),
  schemas: {
    // Define your entities here
  },
});
```

### Converting Schemas

Transform your data models to Drift KV entities using Zod schemas:

**Deno KV Example:**

```typescript
const kv = await Deno.openKv();
const prefs = {
  username: "ada",
  theme: "dark",
  language: "en-US",
};

await kv.set(["preferences", "ada"], prefs);
```

**Drift KV Equivalent:**

```typescript
import { DriftEntity } from "@drift-kv/core";
import { z } from "zod";

const UserEntity = new DriftEntity({
  name: "user",
  schema: (z) => ({
    username: z.string(),
    theme: z.string(),
    language: z.string(),
  }),
});

const drift = new Drift({
  client: await Deno.openKv(),
  schemas: {
    entities: {
      user: UserEntity,
    },
  },
});

await drift.entities.user.create({
  data: {
    username: "ada",
    theme: "dark",
    language: "en-US",
  },
});
```

### Updating CRUD Operations

Replace Deno KV operations with Drift KV methods:


1. Create - Creating new records
   ```typescript
   // Deno KV - No type safety, accepts any key/value pair
   await kv.set(key, value);

   // Drift KV - Type safe with schema validation
   // data: T where T matches your entity schema
   await drift.entities.entityName.create({ data });
   ```

2. Read - Fetching existing records
   ```typescript
   // Deno KV - Returns unknown type, requires manual type casting
   const data = await kv.get(key);

   // Drift KV - Returns fully typed data matching your schema
   // where: { id: string } or other unique identifiers
   const data = await drift.entities.entityName.findUnique({ where });
   ```

3. Update - Modifying existing records
   ```typescript
   // Deno KV - No validation on updated values
   await kv.set(key, updatedValue);

   // Drift KV - Type safe updates with partial schema validation
   // where: unique identifier, data: Partial<T> of your schema
   await drift.entities.entityName.update({ where, data });
   ```

4. Delete - Removing records
   ```typescript
   // Deno KV - Simple key deletion without validation
   await kv.delete(key);

   // Drift KV - Type safe deletion with proper error handling
   // where: { id: string } or other unique identifiers
   await drift.entities.entityName.delete({ where });
   ```

## Direct Comparison: Pros and Cons

| Feature | Deno KV | Drift KV |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Built-in Database | ✅ | Uses Deno KV |
| Type Safety | ❌ | ✅ |
| ORM Capabilities | ❌ | ✅ |
| Schema Definition | Manual | Zod Schemas |
| Advanced Querying | Basic | Advanced |
| Lifecycle Hooks | Limited | Extensive |
| Real-time Subscriptions | Basic | Advanced |

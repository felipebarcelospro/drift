# Drift KV Documentation

Welcome to Drift KV! Drift KV is a powerful, flexible, and type-safe ORM designed to simplify database interactions and provide a seamless developer experience.

## Introduction

Drift KV is a robust Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for modern JavaScript and TypeScript projects. Built to support Deno, Node, and Bun environments, Drift KV helps developers interact with databases efficiently, while maintaining type safety and a rich set of features, including real-time subscriptions, job queues, and type-safe queries.

Drift KV aims to provide an intuitive API, inspired by Prisma and other modern ORMs, but designed to maximize flexibility and performance.

## Getting Started

To get started with Drift KV, follow these steps:

1. Install Drift KV from npm or deno.land.
2. Create and configure your database connections.
3. Define entities and use the powerful CRUD API to interact with your database.

Detailed guides are available in the [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started-guide.md).

## Features

- **Type-Safe Queries**: Drift KV provides full type safety, ensuring consistent data interactions.
- **Real-Time Subscriptions**: Subscribe to data changes and react in real-time.
- **Job Queues**: Built-in support for background processing.

## Installation

### Node.js

Install Drift KV using npm:

```bash
npm install @drift-kv/core
```

### Deno

Import Drift KV directly from deno.land:

```typescript
deno add jsr:@drift-kv/core;
```

## Basic Usage

Here is an example of how to set up Drift KV:

```typescript
import { Drift } from "drift-kv";


// Initialize the database client
const client = Deno.openKv();

// Set up Drift KV instance
const drift = new Drift({
  client,
  schemas: {
    entities: {
      user: {
        name: "user",
        schema: (z) => ({
          id: z.string().uuid(),
          name: z.string().min(3).max(100),
          email: z.string().email(),
        }),
      },
    },
  },
});

// Use CRUD operations
await drift.entities.user.create({
  data: {
    id: "123",
    name: "Felipe",
    email: "felipe@example.com",
  },
});
```
